# PROJECT NAME
Movie Sagas

## Description

_Duration: 3 Week Sprint_

This application uses Sagas to dispatch server requests, in this case fetching a list of movies. A user can click on a movie to view its details (retrieved thru a saga) and return to the list to view another movie. It is styled with MUI.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Installation

1. Create a database named `your database name`,
2. The queries in the `tables.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. I recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!

## Usage

1. Select a movie
2. See movie details.
3. Return to list to select another movie
